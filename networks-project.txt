Notes on Data and Plots
------------------------
- The main source file used to generate data is `ns-3.37/scratch/nms-ml.cc`
- The data generated from our experiments can be found in `ns-3.37/data`
- The corresponding plots are found in `ns-3.37/plots`

How to Generate the Plots
-------------------------
- To change the plots, certain parameters have to be changed in the source file:
    - Line 108: Bottleneck buffer size
    - Lines 132, 133: Bottleneck buffer bandwidth/delay
    - Lines 136, 137: Receiver links' bandwidth/delay
    - Lines 139-143: BBR, Cubic links' bandwidths/delays
- To introduce delays to the connections, lines 231, 252 must be changed
- Alterations to the core of BBR can be done in ns-3.37/src/internet/model/tcp-bbr.cc and the
  corresponding header file in the same directory.
- Once the appropriate conditions have been set up, perform a clean build of ns3 and run the
  main source file to generate data and use gnuplot to generate the appropriate graphs.

Note: We have experienced some faulty scenarios under which simply changing
the default TCP congestion control algorithm using `Config::SetDefault` does
not seem to work, so all connections end up using Cubic. In this case, the connections 
will have to be setup using TCP sockets, and then connect and send packets.
